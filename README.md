The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison to identify the best-performing model. This work was completed as part of an internship preparation course on Data Science provided by Internshala Trainings.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The Daily Buzz, a small newspaper company in Sydney, aims to attract more readers by providing accurate weather forecasts through a new column, "The Weather Oracle." The editor-in-chief decided to leverage machine learning to improve rainfall prediction accuracy and hired you as the ML expert for this task. You are required to create an ML model using various classification models to predict rainfall.

### Approach
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train various models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Evaluate each model's accuracy and create confusion matrices.
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of the models to identify the best one.
4. **Model Improvement**: Suggest possible ways to further improve the selected model's performance.

## My Task
As an ML expert at The Daily Buzz, you are given the task to create a ML model to predict the rainfall. So, you have to create a Machine Learning Model using various Classification Models including Decision Trees and Ensemble methods, and compare the accuracy of each model. First, load the data and perform data preprocessing and after data cleaning use decision tree classification and then use Bagging and Boosting techniques along with the Random Forest Classifier then find out the accuracy score of each and create a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance. After completing this, take your best model and write why this model performed better than other models and in what ways you can further improve the accuracy of the selected model.

## Questions Answered
1. **Your views about the problem statement?**
   - The problem statement given by "The Daily Buzz" is an example of a classification problem. The company was founded many years ago and is now struggling to attract more readers. To get more readers, they need to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. To address this, they will start a new column called "The Weather Oracle" to predict the weather for the coming days. Predicting rainfall accurately is a classic challenge in meteorology. So, they need me to use historical weather data and advanced machine learning techniques to build models that help the company attract more viewers. The community will be interested in this because they can plan their activities, from daily commutes to agricultural tasks. I have been hired as an ML expert, and they want me to create an ML model to accurately predict the rainfall in Sydney. I will focus on precision (true negatives) because I believe the most important aspect is predicting if it will not rain today so that people can carry out their daily routines, go to the beach, and so on. If the model predicts rain and it does not rain, it is not a big problem. However, it is a bigger problem if the model predicts that it will not rain and it does rain, as this can lead to people being unprepared for adverse weather, disrupting their plans and potentially causing more significant inconvenience or harm.

2. **What will be your approach to solving this task?**
   - First, I will import the libraries and some functions that I will need further. I will import the data and I will make data processing following these steps:

     1. Data verification and visualization: I will use methods such as describe(), df.info, df.shape, and df.isnull to verify the data, check for null values, and identify discrepancies in the data.
     2. Replacing Missing Values: For columns with a high number of null values, I will fill them with the median to maintain data consistency without introducing bias. For categorical data, I will fill missing values with the mode. For columns with a lower number of null values, I will fill them with the mean since these values are less likely to interfere with the data significantly.
     3. Dropping unnecessary columns: After checking the data, I will identify and drop columns that are not needed, such as 'date' and 'location'.
     4. Creating Dummies: I will create dummy variables using pd.get_dummies with ('drop_first = true') for categorical data because many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, and creating dummies allows us to convert categorical data into a number format that can be provided to these algorithms.
     5. Correlation and data redundancy: I will perform a correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features. This will help me identify which features are most strongly related to the target variable (rainfall prediction) and each other. I will use methods such as df.corr() to calculate the correlation matrix and visualize it with a heatmap. I will drop columns to avoid data redundancy and multicollinearity and also select the most relevant features for the model.
     6. Plotting scatter and box plots: I will create scatter plots and box plots to visualize the data distributions and relationships between features. Scatter plots will help identify patterns and relationships between numerical variables, while box plots will help detect the presence of outliers and understand the spread and central tendency of the data.
     7. Handling outliers: I will identify and handle outliers in the data. Outliers can skew the results and affect the performance of the machine learning model. I will use the percentile method to detect outliers and decide whether to remove them or transform them to minimize their impact on the analysis.

     After completing data processing, I'll split the data into training and testing sets. Then, for models requiring scaled data, I will standardize it using Standard Scaler. And now I can perform my models such as Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Classification Trees.

     I will proceed with building models using ensemble and boosting techniques. First, I will construct the models, then I will search for the best hyperparameters using either random search or grid search. Once the best hyperparameters are identified, I will fit the model and plot the results, including a graph for each parameter and a table summarizing the results of the grid search. Then, I will assess the model's performance using accuracy, precision, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix for both the training and testing data. This comprehensive evaluation will provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its predictive capabilities.

     For the model that can perform better, I will conduct a deep search for each hyperparameter to find the best fit, aiming for the highest precision while minimizing changes to the average accuracy. I will prioritize precision because accurately predicting non-rainy days is crucial. However, I don't want the model to drastically decrease its accuracy. I will plot graphs, tables, and scores to visualize and evaluate the results comprehensively.

3. **What were the available ML model options you had to perform this task?**
   - As I mentioned, the task is a classification problem, so I have the following available options for models: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Classification Trees. For ensemble techniques, I have Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost. For hyperparameter tuning, I will use Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters.

4. **Which modelâ€™s performance is best and what could be the possible reason for that?**
   - All of the models perform well, but the XGBoost Random Forest stands out with the best performance. Therefore, I conducted a deep search for each hyperparameter to find the best fit aiming for the highest precision while minimizing changes to the average accuracy. This process involved an extensive grid search and cross-validation to meticulously explore a wide range of hyperparameter values. The model achieved the best scores through this thorough optimization.

     I believe this success is due to the models combination of the strengths of random forests and XGBoost
   
     the random forest component reduces overfitting and improves generalization by averaging multiple decision trees. Meanwhile, the XGBoost boosting aspect incrementally enhances the model, making it more accurate in capturing complex patterns in the data. This deep search for optimal hyperparameters ensured that the model was fine-tuned to provide precise and reliable predictions

5. **What steps can you take to improve this selected modelâ€™s performance even further?**
   - To improve the performance of all models i can do feature engineering by creating new or transforming existing features, handle imbalanced data , apply cross-validation to ensure robust generalization, use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, combine predictions from multiple models with ensemble methods, and perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters.

And then after that i will get the model that performs better , and with that model i will do a deep search.

I did it for the best model Xbg Random Forest 
Firt i chose to start tuning the max_depth and min_child_weight params ,i use grid search and get the grapich of the values, the table of the search and the best params , after exploring this i see that this best param are the best ones
now i will do the same for gamme param , for that param i see that the score dont change wen i increment or decrement this value sÃ³ i will not change
now i have the Tuning the reg_alpha and reg_lambda param to tuning , i aplied the same and after exploring and analyzations i get the best values os this params I did it for the best model, XGBoost Random Forest. First, I started tuning the max_depth and min_child_weight parameters using grid search. I plotted the graph of the values, reviewed the search table, and identified the best parameters. These turned out to be the optimal ones

Next, I tuned the gamma parameter. I found that changing this value didn't affect the score much, so I decided not to adjust it
Then, I tuned the reg_alpha and reg_lambda parameters. Using the same grid search method, I explored and analyzed the results to find the best values for these parameters.
After that, I focused on tuning the colsample_bynode and colsample_bytree parameters. These had a significant impact on the score, with noticeable changes when I adjusted their values. I conducted a more in-depth search for these parameters. Initially, using precision as the scoring metric led to overfitting and a significant decrease in accuracy. Switching to accuracy as the scoring metric showed that while accuracy didn't improve much, it provided different optimal parameter values.
The final step was to combine these sets of values to find a balance. This involved finding a combination that achieved good precision without drastically reducing accuracy.
So now i will tuning the colsample_bynode and colsample_bytree params , i did the same and for these parameters i saw that it has a significantlly param to change the score , when i descrease or increment the values the scores changes.For this parameters i will do a more profun search so first i see that when i used scoring equal to 'precision' the model seens be overfiting and the acurracy decresments a lot , then i did the same but i changed the score to 'accuracy' to see how it comports , i saw that when i do that the accuracy dont increse so much compared to other models but i get a other values of params 
Then what i need to do is a combination of this 2 values to get the value that cant give me a good precion but not decresa my acurracy so much
